BitTorrent client that's capable of parsing a .torrent file and downloading a file from a peer.

**Note**: This is originally a [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) challenge.


1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.70)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_bittorrent.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
